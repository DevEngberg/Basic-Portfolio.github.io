            Greetings, Folks!

        <p>
            My name is Chris, and I'm a passionate designer located in NE Minneapolis. I have a black belt in cheese consumption and I'm a design nerd!

            This includes in-house experience and freelance work. 
            <p>Working with other creative people is very important to me and I would love to work with you! I specialize in digital/print design, branding, illustration, 
            and web design. Contact me for your next project!
            </p>
